                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Onion soups have been popular at least since Roman times. Onions, a widely grown and generally inexpensive vegetable, were very familiar to the French. In the book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, it is said "It is hard to imagine a civilization without onions". In general, the onion was actually regarded as peasant food and the upper classes avoided it; in the middle of the 18th century a cookery book by the head chef to a French prince included a recipe for "peasant-style onion soup" – known as ‘soupe à l'oignon à la Paysanne’. The dish is popular throughout France and "apparently no region lays particular claim to it". 
Although onions were plentiful and affordable by the poor, a medieval recipe in Le Ménagier de Paris, published in 1393, includes among its ingredients ginger and saffron – rare and expensive spices – making this version of the dish one for wealthy households. According to some sources, onion soup was introduced to the royal court at Versailles in the 18th century after Louis XV’s father-in-law, the exiled Polish King Stanislas, enjoyed it at an inn and insisted on learning the recipe. It consisted of three main ingredients: fried onions, water and croutons. A recipe in the Dictionnaire des alimens, vins et liqueurs, published during Louis XV's reign, is similar, but adds "a spoonful of good lean broth" before serving. From this we can see the similarities to today’s version, despite the 300-year difference. 
The modern version of French onion soup dates from the mid 1800’s, in Les Halles, the large open-air market in Paris. The restaurants around the market served the soup with a substantial topping of grated cheese and put under a grill.  
In Britain, a recipe for French onion soup was printed in The Cook and Housewife's Manual, published in Edinburgh in 1827. While similar to the modern version, the onions were gently cooked and then simmered in veal stock. The dish was introduced to the United States in 1861 in a New York restaurant. More papers in Britain began giving recipes described as "French onion soup" in the 1880s, but the cooking liquid was either milk or water thickened with flour, and no cheese, crouton or gratinating was specified. In the first half of the 20th century onion soup bars became popular in London, around Piccadilly Circus, staying open all night to sell onion soup to late-night party-goers. </p>
